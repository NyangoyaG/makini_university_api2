Welcome to the Makini University API! ðŸŽ“
This REST API is designed to integrate student data and payment notifications efficiently and developer-friendly. Think of it as a lightweight bridge between student records and payment systems.

Features

âœ… Fetch student information by ID
âœ… Record payments made by students
âœ… Track payment history
âœ… Simple, clean, and ready-to-use REST endpoints

Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/NyangoyaG/makini_university_api2.git
cd makini_university_api


Set up a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Seed the database

python3 seed_db.py


This will create studentDb.db with predefined students and payment structures.

Run the API server

uvicorn myMain:app --reload


Open your browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You should see:

{"message":"Welcome to Makini University API"}

API Endpoints

Notes

SQLite is used for simplicity, but the setup is compatible with other databases.

The timestamp for payments is automatically generated when a payment is recorded.

Relationships between Students and Payments are set using SQLAlchemy relationship() for seamless data retrieval.
